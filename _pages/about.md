Hi there, welcome to my homepage! I’m Chenxuanyin Zou. I am currently a PhD student in the Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering at the University of British Columbia (UBC), supervised by [Prof. Yankai Cao](https://chbe.ubc.ca/yankai-cao/). I also serve as a teaching assistant for [CHBE 356](https://vancouver.calendar.ubc.ca/course-descriptions/courses/chbev-356-process-dynamics-and-control) (since 2025). I previously completed my Master’s degree in Control Theory and Control Engineering at Northeastern University (2020.09–2023.07), where I also earned my Bachelor’s degree (2016.09–2020.06).


Research Interests
======

My research interests focus on Optimization and Process Control. Specifically, I work on:

- Mixed-integer programming for training decision tree models
- Multi-objective optimization for continuous problems
- Optimal control for nonlinear systems with path constraints

The goal of my research is to develop efficient algorithms for Machine Learning models and design effective control methods for complicated nonlinear systems. Feel free to see my [CV](https://ChenxuanyinZou.github.io/ChenxuanyinZou/CV.pdf) to learn more!
