Hi there, welcome to my homepage! I’m Chenxuanyin Zou. I am currently a PhD student in the Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering at the University of British Columbia (UBC), supervised by [Prof. Yankai Cao](https://chbe.ubc.ca/yankai-cao/). I also serve as a teaching assistant for [CHBE 356](https://vancouver.calendar.ubc.ca/course-descriptions/courses/chbev-356-process-dynamics-and-control) (since 2025). I previously completed my Master’s degree in Control Theory and Control Engineering at Northeastern University (2020.09–2023.07), where I also received my Bachelor’s degree (2016.09–2020.06). 

Research Interests
======
My current research focuses on developing efficient algorithms for Machine Learning (ML) architectures, specifically decision trees (orthogonal, oblique, and robust) and clustering models (K-medoids, K-center). A key objective is the integration of these algorithms with control strategies for complex nonlinear systems. My work lies at the intersection of **Optimization** and **Process Control**, specifically addressing:
- Mixed-integer programming and dynamic programming for training ML models;
- Deterministic multi-objective optimization methods for continuous problems;
- Optimal control of nonlinear systems with guaranteed constraint satisfaction.
